# 🏝️ Treasure Island - Text-Based Adventure Game

Welcome to **Treasure Island**, a fun and simple text-based adventure game written in Python!

## 🎮 Game Description

In **Treasure Island**, your mission is to find the hidden treasure by making the right choices at every turn. The game uses conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to guide players through a series of decisions, with only one correct path to victory.

You'll encounter:

* A mysterious crossroad
* A lake with a tricky choice
* A house with three colored doors

Choose wisely... or face the consequences! 🔥 🐊 🐻

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

* Basic Python syntax
* Using `print()` for game narration
* Accepting user input with `input()`
* Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
* Simple game logic design

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

* Add more story branches
* Use functions to modularize the code
* Add ASCII animations or sound using external libraries
* Turn it into a web game using Flask or Django
